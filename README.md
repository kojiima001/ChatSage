# ChatSage

ChatSage is a smart and interactive chatbot designed to provide accurate answers to your questions. Powered by a structured knowledge base, ChatSage retrieves information from a JSON file, ensuring quick and reliable responses. If an answer isnâ€™t available, it informs the user, making it a helpful learning companion.

## Features
